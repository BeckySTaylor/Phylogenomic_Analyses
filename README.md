# Phylogenomic_Analyses

This repository has the code used for all analysis of re-sequenced genomes for our manuscript undertaking phylogenomic analyses to investigate phylogenomic history of 66 re-sequenced caribou genomes, as well as investigation of introgression between lineages and rapidly evolving genes.
