#Usine program 'Dsuite' to calculate D statistics, F4-ratio, and f-branch statistics from the VCF file using the phylogeny newick file (-t) as input
#Also requires a 'SETS' file to tell the program which 'group' each individual in the VCF file belongs to. 
#As we wanted to measure introgression between the lineages in the phylogeny, we assign each individual to their lineage in a file that looks like:

15460   NM1
17825   NWB
17896   NM1
20917   NAL
21332   BRG
21350   BRG
etc

#Run Dtrios first using the tree to output D stats and F4 stats of all combinations of the lineages

./Dsuite/Build/Dsuite Dtrios -n Name_of_run -t treefile.nwk \
../VCF_files/Name.vcf.gz ./Phylogenetics_66_SETS.txt

#Then use the output file ending in '_tree.txt' as well as the newick tree again as input for the Fbranch run:

./Dsuite/Build/Dsuite Fbranch treefile.nwk Phylogenetics_66_SETS.txt

#The Fbranch output goes into the standard out file. I renamed this to Fbranch.txt and copied it and the newick tree into the folder where the python script for plotting is:
#And then use this to create plot:

dtools.py Fbranch.txt treefile.nwk
