#Make input file from VCF using Plink

plink --vcf ./NAME.vcf --make-bed --out Out_name --allow-extra-chr

#Prune the data according the observed sample correlation coefficients to account for LD.
#Firstly have to make sure that the bim file has different ID numbers for each SNP (in this case the line number), do this in a way that we keep the old bim file:

awk '{$2=NR;print $0}' Out_name.bim > Out_name.bim.tmp
mv ./Out_name.bim ./Out_name_unedited.bim
mv ./Out_name.bim.tmp ./Out_name.bim

#Then use Plink again -this targets each SNP that has an R2 value of greater than 0.1 with any other SNP within a 50-SNP sliding window (advanced by 10 SNPs each time).
#Will create a file with a list of unlinked SNPs

plink --bfile Out_name --indep-pairwise 50 10 0.1 --allow-extra-chr

#Then use below to create the pruned dataset only keeping the unlinked SNPs:

plink --bfile Out_name --extract plink.prune.in --make-bed --out Out_name_pruned --allow-extra-chr

#This copies the remaining (untargetted) SNPs to Out_name_pruned.bed
# ADMIXTURE does not accept chromosome names that are not human chromosomes. We will thus just exchange the first column by 0

awk '{$1=0;print $0}' Out_name_pruned.bim > Out_name_pruned.bim.tmp
mv ./Out_name_pruned.bim ./Out_name_pruned.bim.unedited
mv ./Out_name_pruned.bim.tmp ./Out_name_pruned.bim

#Then run ADMIXTURE
