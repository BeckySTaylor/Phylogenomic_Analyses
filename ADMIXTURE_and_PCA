#ADMIXTURE and PCA
#Make input file from VCF using Plink

plink --vcf ./NAME.vcf --make-bed --out Out_name --allow-extra-chr

So we can prune the data according the observed sample correlation coefficients to prune for linkage.
#Firstly use:

awk '{$2=NR;print $0}' Out_name.bim > Out_name.bim.tmp
mv ./Out_name.bim ./Out_name_unedited.bim
mv ./Out_name.bim.tmp ./Out_name.bim

#To make sure that the bim file has different ID numbers for each SNP (in this case the line number). Using this code ensures you keep the old bim
#Then use Plink again -this targets each SNP that has an R2 value of greater than 0.1 with any other SNP within a 50-SNP sliding window (advanced by 10 SNPs each time).
#Will create a file with a list of unlinked SNPs

plink --bfile Out_name --indep-pairwise 50 10 0.1 --allow-extra-chr

#Then use below to create the pruned dataset only keeping the unlinked SNPs:

plink --bfile Out_name --extract plink.prune.in --make-bed --out Out_name_pruned --allow-extra-chr

#This copies the remaining (untargetted) SNPs to Out_name_pruned.bed
#ADMIXTURE does not accept chromosome names that are not human chromosomes. We will thus just exchange the first column by 0

awk '{$1=0;print $0}' Out_name_pruned.bim > Out_name_pruned.bim.tmp
mv ./Out_name_pruned.bim ./Out_name_pruned.bim.unedited
mv ./Out_name_pruned.bim.tmp ./Out_name_pruned.bim

#Then run ADMIXTURE for K=1 to K=10

for K in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; \
 do admixture --cv Out_name_pruned.bed $K -j2 | tee log${K}.out; done
 
#This script will also do a cross-validation to check for the 'best' k value. It also uses 2 (-j) cores.

#To look at the cross-validation errors:

grep -h CV log*.out

#Then run PCA in plink - using the plink prune in file and the other files as above from ADMIXTURE - however use the unedited bim file from the prune run

plink --bfile Out_name_pruned.bed --out name --extract plink.prune.in --pca --allow-extra-chr
