#Download the programe locally

wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip

unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip

#There should now be a 'snpEff' directory. They have a whole load of annotations you can use but we need to use our own and so we have to do a few tweaks.

#Need to add a note in the configuration file to add the name of our reference

nano snpEff.config 

#Under where is says: '# Non-standard Databases' copy in this:

#Caribou genome
Caribou.genome : Rangifer_tarandus

#Then we need to put in the reference genome and annotations (gff file) for the programe to use.

mkdir data

cd data

mkdir genomes

mkdir Caribou

#In the 'Genomes' folder you must copy in the fasta file with the genome sequence, but make sure the name is 'Caribou.fa'

#In the 'Caribou' folder you must copy in the predicted genes 'gff' file, and make sure it is named 'genes.gff'

#The move into the 'snpEff' directory and build the database using:

java -jar snpEff.jar build -v Caribou

#Then we can annotate our VCF file using:

java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar Caribou ./Name.vcf > annotated.vcf

#Outputs a new VCF file which has the annotations added to each line. See here for explanations:

http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html#ann

#There is also a html file which yu can open in a browser, and a 'genes.txt' file with a list of the annotations.
