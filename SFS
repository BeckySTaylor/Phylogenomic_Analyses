##SFS calculation

#Using easySFS, run separately on a VCF file for each lineage and for each category of load:

#First run the preview, example for the loss of function alleles in the ARC lineage:

./easySFS/easySFS.py -i ./ARC_LOF.recode.vcf -p ./Pop_ARC.txt -a --preview

#Then choose the number to include in the projection, whichever has the highest value (here we have no missing data so should be the highest one). 
#For ARC this is 16 as there are 8 diploid individuals

./easySFS/easySFS.py -i ./ARC_LOF.recode.vcf -p ./Pop_ARC.txt -a --proj 16
